# Music-Composer-AI
AI enabled Music Composer that helps user compose Novel Composition

Python Notebook uses deep learning algorithms wherein multiple layers of “neural networks” are programmed to music information between various input and output notes. Although only loosely based on the human brain’s neural structure, it helps to think of it that way. This allows the AI to understand and model high-level abstractions in note-data, such as the patterns in a melody or harmony.

We have taught this deep neural network to understand the art of music composition by reading through a large database of classical partitions written by the most famous composers (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, etc). AI Composer is capable of capturing concepts of music theory just by doing this acquisition of existing musical works. This Model was initially trained on 50 Piano .MIDI files -  and some of the newly created composition samples are in the repo. CPU based training took over 30 mins. 

To use the python notebook, create a folder train & put .MIDI files into it. Notebook is configured to encode .MIDI files into relevant data-format required for the AI Model to generate ouput. Output generated by the AI based composer model is then decoded & .MIDI format file output is created locally. Since the training data-set had Piano .Midi File, so the pre-trained model in the repo is trained for piano. In case you have .MIDI files for drum, you can have an AI model for drum.

Futher you can modify and have hybrid model that combines Piano & Drum Notes to generate compositions containing multiple instruments. (TBD)
